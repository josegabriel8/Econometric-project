"¿Qué Impacto Tiene el Empleo Rural No Agrícola en los Niveles de Pobreza? Un Análisis para los Territorios Rurales de la República Dominicana"

Abstract:

The rural areas of the Dominican Republic have experienced a marked decline in terms of development, poverty, and well-being compared to urban areas. The rural population (especially young people and women) has gradually decreased each year, making the rural economy increasingly vulnerable. A narrow economic base and a concentrated labor market are among the main causes of low-income levels for families living in these rural areas.

In recent decades, Dominican rural areas have undergone a transformation in their economic structure. Although agriculture remains the dominant sector in terms of employment, non-agricultural sectors have slowly gained importance among the activities carried out by rural inhabitants. Based on this structural change, this study seeks to find and describe the impact of the increase in non-agricultural rural employment on poverty levels in Dominican rural areas. The empirical results found in this research demonstrate that there is indeed a negative relationship between poverty levels and the percentage of non-agricultural occupations in rural areas. However, the magnitude of this relationship will largely depend on the type of employment and the specific group of the rural population being analyzed.
